      <description>Hello! Iâ€™m Mustafa, a software engineer currently working at Brndstr.
I work on building chatbots with integrations for brands and on realtime systems for interactive twitter campaigns.
I love learning new things related to programming and beyond. I spend a lot of my free time browsing Reddit or Medium for interesting tidbits of information.
I enjoy coding as a hobby. My GitHub is currently bare but I hope to be more involved in the coming weeks.</description>
